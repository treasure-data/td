* add connector commands.
* add tsv.gz format to export command.
* add --null option to job:show that specifies what character to represent
  null value in csv or tsv format. It emits 'null' by default for backward
  compatibility but you can specify '--null ""' to use empty string instead
  of 'null'.
* fix: remove illegal TAB character at the end of header record. Thanks y-ken!
* fix: do fancy format of numbers in table:list only if format is 'table'.
* fix: job:show to convert NaN to empty String if format is csv or tsv. The
  column data NaN, Infinity and -Infinity caused an error if previous
  versions.  If json format is specified it still raises an error because JSON
  format does not have representation of those values.
* fix: internal cwd handling for auto jar update that caused import:upload to
  fail by changing cwd before reading specified file.
* fix: table:list to consider import_only databases. It just skips such
  databases and no longer crashes with insufficient permission.

== 2015-02-20 version 0.11.8

* Fix: save CSV/TSV file without transcoding.

  The fix in 9d74b44b533878ee5f2a84db3506279f87f85bef at 0.11.7 broke the
  job:show command when the download format is CSV or TSV and the target
  query result contains non UTF-8 encoded byte sequence.

  0.11.6 and before does transcoding and *sanitizes* non UTF-8 byte
  sequence before saving to file. So the generated file is always in
  UTF-8, but could be broken when query result is not in UTF-8.

  0.11.7 simply removes that transcoding logic by
  9d74b44b533878ee5f2a84db3506279f87f85bef for performance and crashes for
  non UTF-8 encoded byte sequence.

  This release fixes 0.11.7 and saves non UTF-8 encoded byte sequence
  as-is (through 'BINARY' encoding) so that the generated file should be
  properly encoded in UTF-8, Shift_JIS, or whatever.

== 2015-02-16 version 0.11.7

* Fix server:endpoint command not working
* Experimental new feature: timeout for import subcommands.  To prevent Java
  process stall this option allows user to specify maximum execution seconds
  for import subcommands by --bulk-import-timeout option. When execution
  exceeds specified seconds the command fails after sending SIGQUIT to
  internal java process if it's not running on Windows.
  NOTE1: the execution time is measured against all subcommand execution. If
  the command parameter designates perform and commit execution the whole
  time could be longer than just uploading part files.
  NOTE2: this option is not shown in help at this moment.
* Show full query text for CSV, TSV, and JSON output format (It's now only
  truncated in table format)
* msgpack.gz to CSV/TSV perf optimization. It should be faster around 2 times
  than before.
* Allow to disable table data expiration by setting the period to 0.
* Fix sched:history crash when scheduled_at == ""
* Several spec fixes. Thanks @yakitorii!

== 2014-12-03 version 0.11.6

* Support HTTP proxy for bulk import

== 2014-10-16 version 0.11.5

* Updated 'td-client' gem dependency to 0.8.66. The new gem addresses the
  recently exposed SSLv3 'Poodle' vulnerability by upgrading both the HTTPClient
  dependency and patching the Net::HTTP gem to force SSLv3 disabled.

== 2014-09-25 version 0.11.4

* Expand file path containing wildcards and not escaped by the underlying shell
* Add a global '-r / --retry-post-requests' option to enable the td-client-ruby
  retrying mechanism for post request.
  Note: -r option must be right after 'td' before subcommands like: td -r query
  WARNING: enabling this option can lead to unexpected results because the
  retrying mechanism can caused the creation of duplicated resources since the
  POST methods are not idempotent.

== 2014-07-31 version 0.11.3

* Support name updates for schedules using sched:update command
* Update Bulk Import JAR file repository to Central Maven Repository where
  the Bulk Import JAR file is now hosted

  keys
* Handle NotFoundError, AuthError, and ForbiddenError to suppress printing of
  the exception stack traces but yet show the exception class name for reference
  back to the actual HTTP error code
* validate the endpoints provided by -e / --endpoint using the Health-check
  REST API /v3/system/server_status. Validation is avoided for any command
  that does not require connectivity with the Treasure Data REST API server
* JAR update errors are ignored when running import:prepare. This command
  does not require connectivity and can be ran even when the machine is not
  connected to the internet
* Fixed Time based progress indicator to reflect the update interval exactly
* Read logging.properties Logging configuration file from ~/.td/java first,
  then the td repository's location (default). This allows customization of
  the logging for the Java Bulk Import CLI (td-import-java).
* Improve job result downloading by showing the total downloaded size and
  percentage progress (Size based progress indicator). This is done when
  printing the result in tabular format or writing the result on file in csv,
  tsv, json, msgpack, or msgpack.gz formats. When displaying the result in csv,
  tsv, and json format on stdout, the progress indicator is not used since the
  data is progressively streamed in as it's received from the API server

== 2014-06-18 version 0.11.2

* Improve the update experience by showing a download progress indicator
* Fix issue on Windows OS where the JAR version file handle was not closed
  and caused permissions access problems to the file in subsequent attempts
  to open the file
* Add support for other/alternative backends using the -e / --endpoint
  option. The backend can be also saved on the configuration file of use
  via the 'td server:endpoint' or when running 'td -e <newendpoint> account'
  command. The TD_API_SERVER environment variable still takes precedence
  over all these settings
* Removed Treasure Data Result Output database and table name client side
  validation since it's performed in the API backend
* Suppress stack traces for APIError exceptions from the client library
* Changed the default HTTP port from 80 to 443 when interacting with the API
  server to support SSL
* Support working entirely without a configuration file (hence without
  having to run 'td account' prior to using the CLI) by passing the -k option
  on the command line
* don't wipe out the current JAR file if an attempt to retrieve the most updated
  JAR file failed because of network connectivity problems
* Show the job result only for finished jobs: unfinished jobs don't have any
  result to display anyway)
* Honor the HTTP_PROXY setting also when updating the JAR file or the Toolbelt
  itself
* Fix parsing of the HTTP_PROXY variable for the Bulk Loader's usage
* Allow optionally disabling the JAR file auto-update feature by setting the
  TD_TOOLBELT_JAR_UPDATE environment variable to 0

* The error message when the specified schema has columns containing upper case
  alphanumeric characters is improved to be more representative of the problem

* The Java bulk import JAR file is now auto-updated. Checking for an updated
  version is performed hourly

  the '-x / --exclude' option to avoid outputting the query result to stdout as
  well
* The 'Destination' field in the summary for the Bulk import perform output
  from the jobs:show command contains the destination table name in the form of
  a LOAD DATA SESSION query
* Returning the correct non-zero error codes in the occurrence of an exception
* Declare the 'td query' option '--sampling' obsolete. A warning indicating the
  option is obsolete and has no effect will be printed to warn the user
